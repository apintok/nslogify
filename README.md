💻 Small Extension to Pretty Print NetSuite Script Execution Logs.
🌍 Available for Firefox!. I personally use Mozilla Firefox to work with NetSuite and I don't like the way the SuiteScript logs are presented. So I decided to create this Extension. Soon to be available on the addons page.
📌 Initial version goal is to format SuiteScript Logs that are either Arrays or Objects.
🚧 This project is still under development! 🚧 Working still to have it published for any one who wants to use it. There are a lot of things to consider and I am trying to make sure the first version at least works.
👽 Open for help while developing. Just let me know if you want to.
