# nslogify

A Mozilla Firefox browser extension that pretty print SuiteScript logs in NetSuite. It displays Arrays & Objects logs in a humand readable way. This extension was built using Javascript.
## Roadmap

- 💻 Small Extension to Pretty Print NetSuite Script Execution Logs.
- 🌍 Available for Firefox! I personally use Mozilla Firefox to work with NetSuite and I think the SuiteScript logs can be better presented. So I decided to create this Extension. Soon to be available.
- 📌 Initial version goal is to format SuiteScript Logs that are either Arrays or Objects.
- 🚧 This project is still under development!
- 🚧 Working still to have it published for any one who wants to use it. There are a lot of things to consider and I am trying to make sure the first version at least works.
- 👽 Open for help while developing. Just let me know if you want to.
