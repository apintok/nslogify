# nslogify

A Mozilla Firefox browser extension that pretty prints SuiteScript Logs in NetSuite ERP Software. It displays Arrays & Objects logs in a humand readable way. This extension was built using Javascript & CSS. I personally use Mozilla Firefox to work with NetSuite and I think the SuiteScript logs can be better presented. So I decided to create this extension.
## Details

- üåç Available for Firefox!
- üìå The goal is to format SuiteScript Logs that are either Arrays or Objects.
- :package: The extension is built using Parcel Bundler.
- üöß Working still to have it published for any one who wants to use it. There are a lot of things to consider and I am trying to make sure the first version at least works.
- üëΩ Open for help while developing. Just let me know if you want to.
## Local Installation

To install this web extension locally for Firefox, *__only__* the following file structure is needed in order for it to work:

```bash
    nslogify/
        content_scripts/
            nslogify.js
        css/
            style.css
        icons/
            code-48.png
            code-96.png
        manifest.json
        README.md
```

After download the respective file structure. On Firefox open the [about:debugging](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) page and load the extension manifest.json file.

## Reference / Related
The extension that solves this problem already exists for Google Chrome. [See it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netsuite-html-script-note/lipldhgjkmfhamocfcdijcdgjcikcbkk). As it was never made available for Firefox I decided to create one for it.
